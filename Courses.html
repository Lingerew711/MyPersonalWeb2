        <div class="courses">Mobile Programming</div>
        <div class="cd">Course Description:</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Although they have only become widely used in the past few years, mobile devices have already had a tremendous
          impact on our culture
          and its social dynamics. Recent rapid growth in the mobile device market has not been primarily driven by
          voice
          communications, but rather by the
          limitless ways in which these devices may be used to explore our local environments. These new communicative
          modes are expressed through
          small and self-contained “apps” that are focused around a central concept, and that leverage many of the
          advanced features of these devices to
          augment a user’s understanding of her environment. This course operates in two distinct but related modes:
          development, wherein an app is made
          functional; and design, through which an app is made usable. Students will be expected to consider both modes
          when producing their apps.
          Students will work throughout the semester to produce a compelling app of interest to the UNC community.

        <div class="cd">Course Description:</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This course provides a comprehensive overview of website development. Students explore the prevailing
          vocabulary, tools, and standards
          used in the field and learn how the various facets including HTML5, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, multimedia,
          scripting languages,
          HTTP, clients, servers, and databases function together in today's web environment. The course provides a
          solid
          web development foundation,
          focusing on content and client-side (browser) components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, multimedia), with an overview
          of the server-side technologies
          like Nodejs. In addition to user interaction, and personalization, data validation and processing of
          browser‐side data structures, data exchange
          languages, and database access will be discussed. Software and services that are easily incorporated into a
          website (for example, maps, checkout,
          blogs, content management) are surveyed and discussed. Students produce an interactive website on the topic of
          their choice for the final project
          and leave the course prepared for more advanced and focused web development studies

        <div class="courses">Computer Graphics and Multimedia</div>

        <div class="cd">Course Description:</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          The area of multimedia includes a wide variety of data. In this module we will deal with pictures, animation,
          audio and 3D landscapes.
          Images are built out of pixels. Each pixel has a certain color or grey tone. Handling images on this level
          will
          allow us to analyse and
          manipulate images. On the practical side we will program effects in Java. For bringing images to life, e.g.
          for
          animation, we will use
          the established Internet standard SVG. Images in SVG are described using XML documents. This allows
          scalability
          and animation. SVG
          has similar features to FLASH. Completing the introduction to multimedia data we draw our attention to audio
          data. The understanding of
          how to digitize sound and how to deal with sound in the digitalized format (e.g. writing sound effects) and
          its
          practical implementation
          will be the focus here. In the last part of this module we will create virtual landscapes using Java 3D. Apart
          from the basic concepts
          these landscapes contain different forms of lighting and lighting effects, moving objects and objects with
          different behaviors
          (e.g collision behaviors). The main computer language for this module is Java including Java3D.
