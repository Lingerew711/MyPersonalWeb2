    MOBLIE PROGAMMING

    
    Course Description: 
    
            Although they have only become widely used in the past few years, mobile devices have already had a tremendous impact on our culture 
            and its social dynamics. Recent rapid growth in the mobile device market has not been primarily driven by voice communications, but rather by the
            limitless ways in which these devices may be used to explore our local environments. These new communicative modes are expressed through 
            small and self-contained “apps” that are focused around a central concept, and that leverage many of the advanced features of these devices to
            augment a user’s understanding of her environment. This course operates in two distinct but related modes: development, wherein an app is made
            functional; and design, through which an app is made usable. Students will be expected to consider both modes when producing their apps. 
            Students will work throughout the semester to produce a compelling app of interest to the UNC community.
        
                                       
    Course Objective  
    
                    • Produce apps for iOS platform devices (iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch)
                    • Gain a basic understanding of computer architecture and object-oriented programming
                    • Develop a working knowledge of Apple’s Xcode app development tool
                    • Understand mobile design principles
                    •Identify need and opportunity in app markets
                
                    
    FUNDAMENTALS OF WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT 

    
    Course Description: 
    
            This course provides a comprehensive overview of website development. Students explore the prevailing vocabulary, tools, and standards 
            used in the field and learn how the various facets including HTML5, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, multimedia, scripting languages, 
            HTTP, clients, servers, and databases function together in today's web environment. The course provides a solid web development foundation, 
            focusing on content and client-side (browser) components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, multimedia), with an overview of the server-side technologies 
            like Nodejs. In addition to user interaction, and personalization, data validation and processing of browser‐side data structures, data exchange 
            languages, and database access will be discussed. Software and services that are easily incorporated into a website (for example, maps, checkout, 
            blogs, content management) are surveyed and discussed. Students produce an interactive website on the topic of their choice for the final project 
            and leave the course prepared for more advanced and focused web development studies

    COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND MULTIMEDIA

    
    Course Description: 
     
        The area of multimedia includes a wide variety of data. In this module we will deal with pictures, animation, audio and 3D landscapes. 
        Images are built out of pixels. Each pixel has a certain color or grey tone. Handling images on this level will allow us to analyse and 
        manipulate images. On the practical side we will program effects in Java. For bringing images to life, e.g. for animation, we will use 
        the established Internet standard SVG. Images in SVG are described using XML documents. This allows scalability and animation. SVG 
        has similar features to FLASH. Completing the introduction to multimedia data we draw our attention to audio data. The understanding of 
        how to digitize sound and how to deal with sound in the digitalized format (e.g. writing sound effects) and its practical implementation 
        will be the focus here. In the last part of this module we will create virtual landscapes using Java 3D. Apart from the basic concepts 
        these landscapes contain different forms of lighting and lighting effects, moving objects and objects with different behaviors 
        (e.g collision behaviors). The main computer language for this module is Java including Java3D.
    
                                   
    Course Objective  
     
        Students will:

                    • formulate a working definition of interactive multimedia;
                    • demonstrate competence in using the authoring program HyperStudio;
                    • demonstrate the use of animation, digitized sound, video control, and scanned images;
                    • demonstrate the use of Netscape to access the Course Home Page and Tips and Tricks;
                    • use basic instructional design principles in the development of stacks;
                    • develop conceptual maps of content and process for interactive multimedia instructional programs
