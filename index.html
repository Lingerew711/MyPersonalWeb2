â–ª Engineering Student at AAiT
The AAiT (Formerly the College of Engineering) was established in 1953 by the Ministry of Education of Ethiopia, and was housed in a set of building in the compound of
School of Addis Ababa. Initially, only a two year program of Intermediate Engineering studies was offered and students were subsequently sent abroad for the completion
of the student leading to a Bachelor of Science degree (B.Sc).
